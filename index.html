            How to Raise Capital for Your CPG Brand
            <span class="hero-headline-accent">in 2026</span>
          </h1>
          <p class="hero-sub">Taught by an 8x founder, BevNET Person of the Year, and the co-founder who built Suja Juice into a $100 million CPG brand in just over 5 years.</p>
          <p class="hero-desc">
            Raising capital for your CPG brand in 2026 is harder than ever — but it doesn't have to be.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-desc">
            In this <strong>free 2-hour on-demand masterclass</strong>, Jeff Church walks you through exactly what it takes to secure investment for your brand right now. This isn't a theory lecture from someone who's read about fundraising. It's the exact playbook from someone who's done it — 40+ times, across $275M raised, with a median 10x return for his angel investors.
          </p>
          <h3 class="hero-learn-title">In this masterclass, you'll learn:</h3>
          <ul class="hero-benefits">
            <li>How to calculate exactly how much funding your brand actually needs</li>
            <li>How to set a credible valuation investors will respect</li>
            <li>Which legal security to use and why it matters</li>
            <li>How to build an investor deck that gets meetings</li>
            <li>Where to find the right angels and early-stage VCs — and how to approach them</li>
            <li>The financial benchmarks that separate fundable brands from the rest</li>
